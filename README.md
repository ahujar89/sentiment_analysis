# 📝 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project is a **sentiment analysis tool** that classifies text reviews into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments. The model is trained using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Logistic Regression classifier**.

## 📌 Features
✅ Clean and preprocesses text data efficiently  
✅ Converts text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**  
✅ Trains a **Logistic Regression model** for classification  
✅ Provides a **real-time sentiment prediction tool**  
✅ Accepts **both predefined and user-input reviews**
